# Feature Flags Code Transformation Tool Feedback

## Overall Assessment
The code transformation tool is well-structured and makes good use of rewrite-clj for analyzing and modifying Clojure code. The approach of using a test-lookup map to specify feature flag values is flexible and allows for precise control over code transformation.

## Rewrite-clj Usage
The tool makes appropriate use of rewrite-clj's key features:

### Strengths
- Good use of zipper navigation (z/down, z/right, z/next) to traverse the code
- Proper handling of node replacement and removal
- Correct usage of sexpr for analyzing code structure
- Appropriate creation of new nodes when needed (e.g., in make-do-node)

### Potential Improvements
- Consider using z/find and z/find-value for more efficient navigation in some cases
- Could leverage z/subedit-> for safer scoped modifications within let bindings
- Might benefit from using z/skip to avoid processing certain forms

## Edge Cases and Potential Issues

### Unhandled Cases
1. Macro Expansion
   - The tool doesn't handle macros that expand to conditional forms
   - Custom macros that wrap if/when aren't detected

2. Complex Conditionals
   - Nested conditionals might not be fully optimized
   - Boolean operations (and/or) aren't processed
   - Thread-first/last macros containing conditionals aren't handled

3. Namespace Issues
   - Aliased core functions (e.g., if/when from other namespaces)
   - Fully qualified conditionals aren't detected

4. Symbol Resolution
   - Doesn't handle vars from other namespaces
   - Local bindings might shadow vars incorrectly

### Code Examples of Edge Cases

```clojure
;; Macro expansion case
(when-let [x (some-flag)] 
  (do-something))

;; Nested conditional
(when flag-a?
  (if flag-b?
    (when flag-c?
      :result)))

;; Thread macro case
(-> data
    (when flag?
      process-data))

;; Namespace alias case
(require '[clojure.core :as c])
(c/when flag? :result)
```

## Code Traversal Approach

### Strengths
- Sequential processing of let bindings maintains correct scope
- Good separation of concerns between transformation and traversal
- Efficient single-pass traversal of the code

### Improvement Suggestions

1. Consider a more declarative approach to transformation rules:
```clojure
(def transformations
  {'when     {:true  transform-when-true
              :false transform-when-false}
   'if       {:true  transform-if-true
              :false transform-if-false}
   'when-not {:true  transform-when-not-true
              :false transform-when-not-false}})
```

2. Add support for transformation contexts:
```clojure
(defrecord Context [locals macros aliases])

(defn transform-with-context [zloc context]
  ;; Transform with awareness of full context
  )
```

3. Consider a visitor pattern for more flexible traversal:
```clojure
(defprotocol ASTVisitor
  (visit-if [this zloc])
  (visit-when [this zloc])
  (visit-let [this zloc]))
```

## Recommendations

1. Add Configuration Options
   - Allow customization of which forms to process
   - Support for custom transformation rules
   - Namespace handling configuration

2. Enhance Safety
   - Add validation for test-lookup expressions
   - Implement undo/preview capabilities
   - Add warning system for potentially unsafe transformations

3. Improve Debugging
   - Add logging of transformations
   - Include source mapping information
   - Provide detailed explanation of changes

4. Extend Functionality
   - Support for more conditional forms
   - Handle macro expansion cases
   - Add pattern matching capabilities

## Testing Suggestions

1. Add test cases for:
   - All conditional combinations
   - Nested conditionals
   - Complex let bindings
   - Namespace resolution
   - Macro expansion cases

2. Consider property-based testing for:
   - Code structure preservation
   - Transformation correctness
   - Performance characteristics

## Performance Considerations

The current implementation is generally efficient, but could be optimized for:
- Large files with many conditionals
- Deep nesting of forms
- Complex let binding chains

Consider memoization of common transformations and caching of local binding resolutions for performance improvements in large codebases.
